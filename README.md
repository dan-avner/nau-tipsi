This is the most up to date version of the MATLAB code for TIPSI GUI. Please do not change anything without contacting  Dan Avner (davner@nau.edu) about changes. 


Overview:
camera_control.m
camera_control.fig 
tipsi.png
naulogo.png
uiwaitbar.m




The TIPSI GUI requires these files to run and operate. The main code process is in camera_control.m while the gui creation is in camera_control.fig. Please use MATLAB Guide to change the gui and do not mess with the hardcoding. 


To change out the nau logo just replace with the same name of the file along with the TIPSI logo.
